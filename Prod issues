2. Sqoop Production Issues

2.1. Sqoop Job Failures

Description: Sqoop jobs may fail during data import/export from RDBMS to HDFS.

Possible Causes:

Network issues between Hadoop and RDBMS.

Incorrect JDBC connection details.

Timeout due to large data volumes.


Solutions:

Ensure stable network connectivity.

Verify JDBC connection strings, credentials, and configurations.

Increase timeout values (--connect, --connect-timeout) as needed.



2.2. Inconsistent Data Import

Description: Data imported from RDBMS may be incomplete or incorrect.

Possible Causes:

Mismatched schemas between source and target.

Null values or incorrect delimiters in data.

Outdated metadata in the target database.


Solutions:

Validate data types and ensure correct schema mapping.

Use the --null-string and --fields-terminated-by options to handle data formats.

Perform checksums or data validation after import.



2.3. Performance Issues with Large Tables

Description: Sqoop import/export performance degrades with large datasets.

Possible Causes:

Insufficient parallelism.

Poor database indexing.

I/O bottlenecks.


Solutions:

Increase the number of mappers using the --num-mappers option.

Optimize database indexing on columns used for partitioning (--split-by).

Use incremental imports (--incremental) for large tables to reduce load.



2.4. Data Type Mismatches

Description: Mismatches between RDBMS and Hadoop data types can cause import failures or data inaccuracies.

Possible Causes:

Unsupported or unrecognized data types.

Incompatible type conversions.


Solutions:

Use the --map-column-java option to explicitly map RDBMS types to Java types.

Preprocess data to ensure compatibility before import.



2.5. Handling Incremental Data Loads

Description: Challenges in managing and importing incremental data updates.

Possible Causes:

Incorrect configuration of incremental options.

Overlapping or missing data during incremental imports.


Solutions:

Utilize --incremental append or --incremental lastmodified appropriately.

Ensure reliable tracking columns (e.g., timestamp or auto-increment IDs).

Validate incremental load results to prevent data duplication or omission.



2.6. Authentication and Authorization Issues

Description: Failures due to improper authentication or insufficient permissions.

Possible Causes:

Incorrect database credentials.

Lack of necessary permissions for the Sqoop user.


Solutions:

Verify and securely manage database credentials.

Ensure the Sqoop user has appropriate read/write permissions on the RDBMS.



2.7. Handling Complex Queries

Description: Importing data using complex SQL queries can lead to errors or inefficiencies.

Possible Causes:

Syntax errors in custom queries.

Inefficient query execution plans.


Solutions:

Test and validate custom SQL queries independently before using them in Sqoop.

Optimize SQL queries for better performance and compatibility with Sqoop.



2.8. Unsupported Data Types

Description: Certain RDBMS data types may not be directly supported by Sqoop.

Possible Causes:

Use of specialized or custom data types in the source database.


Solutions:

Use the --map-column-java option to map unsupported types to compatible Java types.

Preprocess data to convert unsupported types to supported formats before import.



2.9. Handling NULL Values

Description: NULL values in the source data can cause issues during import.

Possible Causes:

Improper handling of NULLs leading to data inconsistencies.


Solutions:

Use Sqoop options like --null-string and --null-non-string to define representations for NULLs.

Validate data post-import to ensure NULLs are handled correctly.



2.10. Error Handling and Retries

Description: Inadequate error handling can result in incomplete or failed imports without proper recovery.

Possible Causes:

Lack of retry mechanisms for transient failures.

Inadequate logging for troubleshooting.


Solutions:

Implement retry logic using Sqoop's built-in options or external orchestration tools.

Enable detailed logging to capture and diagnose errors effectively.

Description: Sqoop jobs may fail during data import/export from RDBMS to HDFS.

Possible Causes:

Network issues between Hadoop and RDBMS.

Incorrect JDBC connection details.

Timeout due to large data volumes.


Solutions:

Ensure stable network connectivity.

Use --connection-manager to optimize connections.

Increase timeout values (--connection-timeout).



2.2. Inconsistent Data Import

Description: Data imported from RDBMS may be incomplete or incorrect.

Possible Causes:

Mismatched schemas between source and target.

Null values or incorrect delimiters in data.

Known Issues for Apache Sqoop
Learn about the known issues in Sqoop, the impact or changes to the functionality, and the workaround.

CDPD-54770: Unable to read Sqoop metastore created by an older HSQLDB version
If you have upgraded to CDP PvC Base 7.1.8 Cumulative hotfix 4 or higher versions, you may encounter issues in reading the Sqoop metastore that was created using an older version of HyperSQL Database (HSQLDB).
Cloudera upgraded the HSQLDB dependency from 1.8.0.10 to 2.7.1 and this causes incompatibility issues in Sqoop jobs that are stored in HSQLDB.
After upgrading to CDP PvC Base 7.1.8 Cumulative hotfix 4, you must upgrade the Sqoop metastore and convert the database files to a format that can easily be read by HSQLDB 2.7.1. For more information, see Troubleshooting Apache Sqoop issues.
CDPD-44431: Using direct mode causes problems
Using direct mode has several drawbacks:
Imports can cause an intermittent and overlapping input split.
Imports can generate duplicate data.
Many problems, such as intermittent failures, can occur.
Additional configuration is required.
Stop using direct mode. Do not use the --direct option in Sqoop import or export commands.
Sqoop direct mode is disabled by default. However, if you still want to use it, enable it by either setting the sqoop.enable.deprecated.direct property globally in Cloudera Manager for Sqoop or by specifying it in the command-line through -Dsqoop.enable.deprecated.direct=true.
CDPD-3089: Avro, S3, and HCat do not work together properly
Importing an Avro file into S3 with HCat fails with Delegation Token not available.
Parquet columns inadvertently renamed
Column names that start with a number are renamed when you use the --as-parquetfile option to import data.
Prepend column names in Parquet tables with one or more letters or underscore characters.
PARQUET-99: Importing Parquet files might cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors
Importing multiple megabytes per row before initial-page-run check (ColumnWriter) can cause OOM. Also, rows that vary significantly by size so that the next-page-size check is based on small rows, and is set very high, followed by many large rows can also cause OOM.
